This is an implementation of the prejudice-aware regulariser for classification from:

Toshihiro Kamishima, Shotaro Akaho, Hideki Asoh, and Jun Sakuma. Fairness-aware classifier with
prejudice remover regularizer. In PeterA. Flach, Tijl De Bie, and Nello Cristianini, editors, Machine
Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, volume 7524 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
pages 35â€“50. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2012.

The main file to run all is FairnessAwareReg.m. From there each linear regresion model (LR, LR without sensitive 
tures, LR with prejudice aware reularizer with different etta parameter values) is run.

This implementation is based on the paper and on Python source code published by the author:

The orignal Python source code by the author can be found here:

http://www.kamishima.net/fac/

NOTE: On running the data-adultd/generate.sh the directory for 'w' cannot be found, just set it to the current directory.

NOTE: On line 53 of fai_bin_bin.py add a cast to float to fix any parsing errors with the input file: s = int(float(f[opt.sensitive]))

Acknowledgement:

The source code for the logisitic regression cost function and optimization was originally based on code by 'quinnliu', this helped save a lot of time to get started, thank you for sharing!
